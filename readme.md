fuel-me-up-android
==================

An android app that displays car sharing vehicles of drive-now and car2go on a map and filters them by fuel level.


At these two services customers can earn bonus minutes by fueling up a car after the fuel level was below a certain threshold.
The main target of this app is to spot cars with a low fuel level so you can them up and get bonus minutes.
